# API-Test

Using Laravel Framework 

First Test - CRUD REST API
•	Make sure that you are in main branch.
•	Create a new branch and name it 1-crud-api.
•	Create a model with name Event.
•	Event will have these properties.
•	id -> PK, UNIQUE, value must be a UUID.
•	name -> String.
•	createdAt -> NOT NULL, DateTime.
•	updatedAt -> NOT NULL, DateTime.
•	Create these APIs.
•	GET /api/v1/events -> Return all events from the database.
•	GET /api/v1/events/active-events -> Return all events that are active = current datetime is within startAt and endAt.
•	GET /api/v1/events/{id} -> Get one event.
•	POST /api/v1/events -> Create an event.
•	PUT /api/v1/events/{id} -> Create event if not exist, else update the event in idempotent way
•	PATCH /api/v1/events/{id} -> Partially update event.
•	DELETE /api/v1/events/{id} -> Soft delete an event.
•	Seed the database with dummy events (min. 5 events).
•	Merge 1-crud-api with main, use PR.

Second Test - UI
•	Make sure that you are in main branch.
•	Create a new branch and name it 2-ui.
•	Create these views.
•	/events -> Show all events in the table (search and pagination has bonus point). Last column should display 2 buttons on each row to update and delete the event.
•	/events/{id} -> Show individual event.
•	/events/create -> Create an event.
•	/events/{id}/edit -> Edit an event.
•	Merge 2-ui with main, use PR.

Third Test - Advance Topic
•	Make sure that you are in main branch.
•	Create a new branch and name it 3-advance-topic.
•	Implement these features.
•	Server side data caching with redis.
•	Send an email everytime an event is created (you can use mailtrap or other smtp provider that's easy to setup).
•	Authentication -> only authenticated users can create, update and delete events.
•	Calling of an external API(s) and display the data in the UI.
